# FORMULA USED:
1. Input impedance, hib =∆VEB / ∆IE Ω V CB CONSTANT
2. Output admittance, hob = ∆IC /∆VCB mho IE CONSTANT
3. Forward current gain hf b = ∆IC/∆IEVCB= const
4. Reverse voltage gain hrb = VEB/VCB IE = const

# THEORY:
A NPN function transistor consist of a silicon (or germanium) crystal in which a layer of
p – type silicon is sandwiched between two layers of N – type silicon. The arrow on emitter lead
specifies the direction of the current flow when the emitter – base function is biased in the
forward direction since the conductivity of the BJT depends on both the majority and minority
carriers it is called bipolar device. In CE configuration emitter is the i/p terminal, collector is the
o/p terminal and base is common to both input and Output.

# PROCEDURE:
# INPUT CHARACTERISTICS
1. Connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. VCB is kept const (say 5v), VEB is varied insteps of 0.1v and the corresponding IB
values are tabulated. The above procedure is repeated for 10v, 15v , etc.
3. Graph is plotted between VBE and Ie for a constant VCb
4. The h-parameters values are found from the graph.
   
# OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS
1. Connection are made as per the circuit diagram
2. IE is kept const, VCB is varied in step IV the corresponding IC values are tabulated.
3. The above procedure is repeated for different constant values.
4. Graph is plotted between VCB and Ic for a constant IE.
5. The h – parameter values are found from the graph
   
# CALCULATION OF h PARAMETERS:
A)To find the parameter hfe(Current Gain):
Step1: Draw dotted vertical line
corresponding to any constant Vcb. This line
will intersect the constant ie curves at
different values of ic on Y- axis.
Step:2 Note down the y- intercept
corresponding to the constant ie curve.
Step3: Let the intersecting pointsbe ic1 and
ic2 on two different curves of Iesay ie1 and
ie2
Step 4: Calculate hfb =∆𝑖𝑐
∆𝑖𝑒vcb= constant
𝑖𝑐2−𝑖𝑐1 = 𝑖𝑒2−𝑖𝑒1

B)To find the parameter hob(Output Admittance):
Step1: Draw dotted vertical lines on one of the output
characteristics curve corresponding to any two constant
Vcb values. This line will intersect the constant ie
curves at different values of ic on Y- axis.
Step 2:Let the intersecting pointsbe ic1 and ic2 on same curve of Ie constant
Step 3: Calculate hoe = ∆𝑖𝑐 \𝑖𝑐2−𝑖𝑐1
ie= constant = ∆𝑉𝑐𝑒\𝑉𝑐𝑒2−𝑉𝑐𝑒1

C)To find the parameter hib(Input Impedance):
Step1:Draw dotted vertical lines on one of the
input characteristics curve corresponding to any two
constant Veb1 and Veb2 values.
Step 2:This line will intersect the constant Vcb

D)To find the parameter hrb(Voltage Gain):
Step1:Draw dotted vertical lines on
