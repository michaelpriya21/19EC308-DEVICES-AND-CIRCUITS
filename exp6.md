# THEORY:
Field effect transistor is a semiconductor device that depends for its operation on the
control of current by an electric field. It’s operation depends on the flow of majority carriers
only. It is therefore a unipolar device. It exhibits a high input resistance. An N- channel JFET
consists of a N-type bar is sandwiched between two heavily doped P-type regions. Due to the
concentration gradient, the depletion region is formed. On both sides of the semiconductor bar
the ohmic contacts are made. One terminal is called source & other is called drain. Both the p-
type regions are connected together.
# PROCEDURE:
# DRAIN CHARACTERISTICS:
1. Connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. Gate –source voltage VGS is kept constant (say –1v), drain voltage VDS is varied
insteps of 1v and the corresponding drain current ID values are tabulated.
3. The above procedure is repeated for VGS= -2v, 0v.
4. The graph is plotted VDS and ID for a constant VGS.
5. The drain resistance is found from the graph
rd =VDS/ID
# TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS:
1. Connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. Drain –source voltage VDS is kept constant (say 5v), the gate – source voltage VGS is
varied insteps of 1v (-VE voltage) and the corresponding drain current ID values are
tabulated.
3. The above procedure is repeated for VDS = 10v, 15v,
4. Graph is plotted between VGS and ID for a constant VDS.
5. The transconductance is found from the graph
gm =ID/VGS
