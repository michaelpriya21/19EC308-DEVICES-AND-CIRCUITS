# THEORY
# PN-JUNCTION DIODE
A diode is a PN junction formed by a layer of P type and layer of N type Semiconductors.
Diode does not conduct. But there will be a leakage current due to minority carrier. Once formed
the free electrons in the N region diffuse across the junction and combine with holes in P region
and so a depletion Layer is developed. The depletion layer consists of ions, which acts like a
barrier for diffusion of charged beyond a certain limit. The difference of potential across the
depletion layer is called the barrier potential.At2.5degree the barrier potential is approximately
equal 0.7v for silicon diode and 0.3v for germanium diode. When the junction is forward bias,
the majority carrier acquired sufficient energy to overcome the barrier and the diode conducts.
When the junction is reverse-biased the depletion layer widens and the barrier potential
increases.

# PROCEDURE
# FORWARD BIAS
1. The connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. The power supply Current Overload is kept at maximum and then switched on.
3. Changing the Volt knob of RPS, increase the applied voltage from 0 V to 0.1 V in
voltmeter and tabulate under Vf.
4. Note down the ammeter reading in Milliamp range as If.
5. Vary the RPS, and change the voltmeter reading in steps of 0.1 V and tabulate the
corresponding current reading till 1 V
6. A graph is drawn between Vf and If.
7. Calculate the slope of linear portion of graph to obtain forward resistance

# REVERSE BIAS
1. The connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. The power supply is switched on and supply voltage is gradually increased and observe
the point where current starts increasing rapidly, note down the voltage as "Breakdown
voltage" and the corresponding Current reading.
3. Now to draw reverse bias characteristics, change ammeter to lower range, less than "
breakdown current"
4. Vary the voltage in steps of 1 V in voltmeter (Vr) and note down the corresponding
current in ammeter (Ir).
5. Do not vary the voltage above the breakdown voltage.
6. Graph is drawn between Vr and Ir
7. The reverse conduction region is extended to meet x-axis at a point. The value at this
point is VBO.

# FORMULA USED
Forward Resistance RF = ΔVF/ ΔIF (Ω)
Reverse Resistance RR = ΔVR/ ΔIR (Ω)
