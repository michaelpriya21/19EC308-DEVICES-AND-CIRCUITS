# THEORY:
A NPN function transistor consist of a silicon (or germanium) crystal in which a layer of
p – type silicon is sandwiched between two layers of N – type silicon. The arrow on emitter lead
specifies the direction of the current flow when the emitter – base Junction is biased in the
forward direction since the conductivity of the BJT depends on both the majority and minority
carriers it is called bipolar device. In CE configuration base is the i/p terminal, collector is the
o/p terminal and emitter is common to both input and output. The ratio of change in Ic to change
in base current Ib is known as Current amplification factor or current gain.

# FORMULEA USED:
1. Input impedance  hie =∆VBE / ∆IB Ω ,VCE constant.
2. Output admittance  hoe = ∆ IC /∆VCE mho,IB constant.
3. Forward current gain hfe = ∆IC/∆IB,VCE= constant.
4. Reverse voltage gain  hre = ∆VBE/∆VCE,IB = constant.

# PROCEDURE:
# INPUT CHARACTERISTICS
1. Connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. VCE is kept const (say 5v), VBE is varied insteps of 0.1v and the corresponding IB values are
tabulated. The above procedure is repeated for different constant values.
3. Graph is plotted between VBE and IB for a constant VCE
4. The h – parameter values are found from the graph.
# OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS
1. Connection are made as per the circuit diagram
2. IB is kept const, VCE is varied in step of 1V,the corresponding IC values are tabulated. The
above procedure is repeated for different IB constant values.
3. Graph is plotted between VCE and Ic for a constant IB.
4. The h – parameter values are found from the graph.

# CALCULATION OF h PARAMETERS:

A) To find the parameter hfe(Current Gain)
Step1: Draw dotted vertical line
corresponding to any constant Vce. This line
will intersect the constant ib curves at different
values of ic on Y- axis.
Step:2 Note down the y- intercept
corresponding to the constant ib curve.
Step3: Let the intersecting pointsbe ic1 and ic2
on two different curves of Ibsay ib1 and ib2
Step 4: Calculate hfe =∆𝑖𝑐
∆𝑖𝑏vce= constant
𝑖𝑐2−𝑖𝑐1 = 𝑖𝑏2−𝑖𝑏1

B)To find the parameter hoe (Output Admittance):
Step1: Draw dotted vertical lines on one of the output
characteristics curve corresponding to any two constant
Vce values. This line will intersect the constant ib curves
at different values of ic on Y- axis.
Step 2:Let the intersecting pointsbe ic1 and ic2 on same
curve of Ib constant
Step3:Calculate hoe = ∆𝑖𝑐

C)To find the parameter hie(Input Impedance):
Step1:Draw dotted vertical lines on one of the
input characteristics curve corresponding to any two
