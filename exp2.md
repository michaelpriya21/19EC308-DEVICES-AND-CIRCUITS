# THEORY:
# ZENER DIODE:
The diodes, which are designed to operate in the breakdown region, are called the Zener
diode. The other name is AVALANCHE diode. There are two types of breakdown in these
diodes they are Avalanche and Zener breakdown. In avalanche breakdown the, conduction in
reverse bias is due to avalanche multiplication of charge carrier. In Zener diode is breakdown is
due to direct rupture of covalent bonds because of strong electric field. The actual intensity of the
electric field strength that produces Zener breakdown is estimated to be 3*10V/cm. Avalanche
breakdowns will have higher breakdown voltages from several volts to several hundred volts.

# PROCEDURE
# FORWARD BIAS
i) The connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
ii) The power supply is switched on.
iii) The forward voltage Vf is increased in small steps and readings are tabulated.
iv) A graph is drawn between Vf and If.
v) The slope of linear portion of graph gives forward resistance and Q point is located.

# REVERSE BIAS
1.The connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2.Multimeter current ranges are used to measure the reverse current.
3.The power supply is switched on and supply voltage is gradually increased.
4.As the reverse bias voltage reaches the breakdown voltage the current through the diode
increases rapidly.
5.The breakdown voltage is noted before the breakdown and
Connection is changed such that lower range
ammeter is included in the circuit .
6.Graph is drawn between Vr and Ir
7.The reverse conduction region is extended to meet x-axis at a point. The value at
this point is Vrb.

# FORMULA USED
Forward Resistance RF = ΔVF/ ΔIF (Ω)
Reverse Resistance RR = ΔVR/ ΔIR (Ω)
