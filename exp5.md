# THEORY:
A NPN function transistor consist of a silicon (or germanium) crystal in which a layer of
p – type silicon is sandwiched between two layers of N – type silicon. The arrow on emitter lead
specifies the direction of the current flow when the emitter – base Junction is biased in the
forward direction since the conductivity of the BJT depends on both the majority and minority
carriers it is called bipolar device. In CC configuration base is the i/p terminal, Emitter is the o/p
terminal and collector is common to both input and output. The output characteristics are the
same as the common emitter configuration.

# FORMULA USED:
Current amplification Factor, γ = ∆ IE/ ∆IB

# PROCEDURE:
INPUT CHARACTERISTICS
1. Connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. VEC is kept const (say 5v).
3. The above procedure is repeated for various fixed values of VEC
3. Graph is plotted between VBC versus IB for different values of VEC
4. The h – parameter values are found from the graph.
# OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS
1. Connection are made as per the circuit diagram
2. IB is kept const, VEC is varied, the corresponding IE values are tabulated. The
above procedure is repeated for different constant values.
3. Graph is plotted between VEC and IE for a constant IB. 4. The h – parameter values are found
from the graph.

# CALCULATION OF h PARAMETERS:
A)To find the parameter hfc(Current Gain):
Step1: Draw dotted vertical line corresponding to any
constant Vce. This line will intersect the constant ib
curves at different values of ie on Y- axis.
Step:2 Note down the y- intercept corresponding to the
constant ib curve.
Step3: Let the intersecting pointsbe ie1 and ie2 on two
different curves of Ibsay ib1 and ib2
∆𝑖𝑒
Step 4: Calculate hfc =
∆𝑖𝑏vce= constant
𝑖𝑒2−𝑖𝑒1 = 𝑖𝑏2−𝑖𝑏1

B)To find the parameter hoc(Output Admittance):
Step1: Draw dotted vertical lines on one of the
output characteristics curve corresponding to any two
constant Vce values. This line will intersect the
constant ib curves at different values of ie on Y- axis.
Step 2:Let the intersecting pointsbe ie1 and ie2 on
same curve of Ib constant

Step 3: Calculate hoe =

C)To find the parameter hic(Input Impedance):
Step1:Draw dotted vertical lines on one of the input
characteristics curve corresponding to any two
constant Vbc1 and Vbc2 values.
Step 2:This line will intersect the constant Vce curve
at different values of ibon Y- axis.

D)To find the parameter hrc(Voltage Gain):
Step1:Draw dotted horizontal line on input
characteristics curvescorresponding to any two constant
Vce1 and Vce2 curves.
Step 2:This line will intersect the constant Vce curve at
different values of Vbcon X- axis.
Step 3: Calculate hrb =∆𝑉𝑏𝑐
